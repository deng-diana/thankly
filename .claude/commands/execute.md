# Execute Stage

Now implement precisely as planned, in full.

## Your Goal

Execute the implementation plan step-by-step, updating progress dynamically.

## Implementation Requirements

- **Write elegant code**: Minimal, modular, and following existing patterns
- **Adhere to conventions**: Match existing code style, naming, and structure
- **Document thoroughly**: Add clear comments explaining complex logic
- **Update tracking**: Mark tasks complete (🟩) as you finish them, update progress %
- **Test as you go**: Verify each component works before moving to next phase

## Workflow

1. Read the implementation plan document
2. Execute tasks phase by phase
3. Update the plan document with:
   - Status emojis (🟥 → 🟨 → 🟩)
   - Overall progress percentage
4. Test after each major phase
5. Fix any issues before moving forward

## When to Stop

- All tasks marked 🟩 Done
- Overall progress = 100%
- All tests passing
- No linter errors

Remember: Quality over speed. Better to do it right than fast.
