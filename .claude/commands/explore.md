# /explore

Start an exploration phase for a new feature or problem. This command is **not**
for implementation; it is for understanding and preparing.

## Your Goal

- Understand the feature request and how it should integrate.
- Inspect the codebase to locate relevant entry points and dependencies.
- Identify edge cases and constraints (keep it reasonable).
- List only the unclear items that need user clarification.

## Output Format

- Short understanding summary
- Where this likely lives in the codebase (files/modules)
- Risks/constraints
- 3–5 targeted questions (only if needed)

## Rules

- Do **not** implement yet.
- Do **not** assume missing requirements.
- Keep it concise and practical.
